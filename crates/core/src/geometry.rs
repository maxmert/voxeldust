//! Overlap-band geometry: where ghosts exist and transfers trigger
//! (`docs/design/transfer_protocol.md` §1.3, hardened by Charter A).
//!
//! Bands are GEOMETRIC (never timeouts — the old system's R8 was timeout-based
//! eviction) with three protections:
//! - **Hysteresis**: ghosts are created crossing the inner edge and destroyed only
//!   beyond the outer edge, so a boundary-hovering entity cannot flap.
//! - **Velocity scaling**: band width must exceed `v_rel · dt · K_SAFETY` so a fast
//!   body cannot skip the band between ticks.
//! - **Swept-segment crossing**: membership evaluation tests the tick's whole motion
//!   segment against the shell, so a 5.5 km/tick body cannot tunnel undetected.
//!
//! Also home of [`system_soi`] — the LUMINOSITY-based, GALAXY-UNIT star-system SOI,
//! deliberately distinct from the mass-ratio, METERS [`crate::celestial::planet_soi`].
